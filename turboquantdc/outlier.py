"""Outlier channel strategy for fractional bit rates.

Extends TurboQuant to support non-integer bit-widths (e.g. 2.5, 3.5) by
splitting channels into two groups after rotation:
    - n_high channels quantized at ceil(target_bits)
    - n_low channels quantized at floor(target_bits)

The rotation is applied once to the full d-dimensional vector, then channels
are split. This preserves the Gaussianization property that makes quantization
optimal — each coordinate of the rotated vector follows the same concentrated
distribution regardless of which group it is assigned to.

The key decomposition for inner products:
    <q, k> = <q_high, k_high> + <q_low, k_low>
where q_high/q_low and k_high/k_low are the rotated vectors split at the
same channel boundary.

    """TurboQuant with outlier channel strategy for fractional bit rates.

    Splits the d dimensions into two groups after rotation:
    - n_high channels quantized at ceil(target_bits) using full TurboQuant
    - n_low channels quantized at floor(target_bits) using full TurboQuant

    The split is determined by target_bits:
        frac = target_bits - floor(target_bits)
        n_high = round(d * frac)
        n_low = d - n_high

    Example (d=128, target_bits=2.5):
        n_high = 64 channels at 3-bit (2-bit MSE + 1-bit QJL)
        n_low = 64 channels at 2-bit (1-bit MSE + 1-bit QJL)
        Average: (64*3 + 64*2) / 128 = 2.5 bits/channel

    The rotation matrix is shared -- it is applied once to the full vector,
    then channels are split. This is important because rotation makes all
    channels equally informative (no "natural" outliers).

    For integer target_bits (e.g. 3.0), n_high=0 and the entire vector
    is quantized at floor(target_bits), behaving like standard TurboQuant.
