"""Proper evaluation for TurboQuantDC KV cache compression.

Replaces the toy 8-prompt keyword-matching benchmark with three tiers:

Tier 1 -- Perplexity (primary, fast, ~30s per config):
    Wikitext-2 perplexity on a 2048-token window.
    Reported as "% perplexity increase" vs FP16 baseline.

Tier 2 -- Generation Quality (medium, ~60s per config):
    12 diverse prompts covering factual recall, math, code, reasoning,
    long-context recall, and translation.
    Scored by comparing compressed output to FP16 baseline output
    using token-level Jaccard similarity + keyword matching.

Tier 2b -- Needle-in-Haystack:
    Embed a fact in context, ask about it later.
    Tests at 512, 1K, 2K, 4K context lengths.

Tier 3 -- LM-eval-harness (thorough, ~5min per config):
    Integration script for MMLU, GSM8K, HellaSwag.
    Not used during autoresearch sweeps (too slow).

Usage:
    from benchmark import BenchmarkRunner

    runner = BenchmarkRunner(model, tokenizer)
    baseline_ppl = runner.compute_model_perplexity()
    result = runner.evaluate_config(config, baseline_ppl)
    # result.total_score, result.ppl_score, result.gen_score, ...
